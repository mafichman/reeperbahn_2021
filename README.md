# reeperbahn_2021

A sample code base from Reeperbahn Pop-n-Politics workshop 2021: The Future of Nightlife: Liberty, Data and Technology with Michael Fichman (UPenn) and Mark Adam Harold (Vilnius Night Alliance).

The things that matter to nightlife and arts communities aren't things that economists or governments measure. You can create the data yourself, and then use it to tell your story.

You can use this survey workflow in your own community with your own questions. Try the survey out and then grab the R Code and try the analysis yourself! Don't know how to code? Build a coalition in your community with people with the skills you need to build your advocacy base.
